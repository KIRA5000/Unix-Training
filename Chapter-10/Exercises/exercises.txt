1. Removing infinite for loop from the main function makes the function
pause run only one time, that's why only one time recive of any signal
calls the handler and terminates the program.

3. Progress of stack frame:
main->
main->sleep2->
main_sleep2->sig_int->
main->sleep2->sig_int->sig_alr->
main->sleep2->                     //due to setjmp sigalr jumps directly to sleep2
main->

4. The problem with the following with code can be that alarm timer can run
out even before getting chance to call setjmp due to race condition, when longjmp
will be called from within the handler it won't have a place to return to because
stejmp haven't been called yet.

7. Because _exit doesn't do clean up, beacuse it's task for exit handlers but
_exit() directly transfers the control to the kernel.

8. siginfo might be sending real id because of process A to send signal to B,
A must be a root process or have same uid or euid as B's uid or euid. If euid 
is same then for B to know uid of A su_uid feild is added.
