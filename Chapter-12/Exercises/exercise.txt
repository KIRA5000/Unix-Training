1. Displaying the output in the file and in terminal have a simple change that is
io buffer type. Terminal devices have line buffer where as file have full buffer
That's why all the printf statements before fork were copied for both child and
parent because till the time of fork calling the buffer was not flushed. It can
be solved by setvbuf.

3. You can't make a function 100% async-signal safe by black all signals in beggining
and unblocking them in end because some signals can't be blocked.

5. We mostly used the child to exec another function which can't be done by threads.

7. We can not because it might conditional variable might be inside the mutex which 
is already locked by another thread.
